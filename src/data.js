        'I have a bachelor of science degree in computer engineering from the University of Kentucky. There, I used a number of languages including Python, JavaScript, C/C++/C#, and HTML. We primarily developed on linux machines which allowed me to gain familiarity with Unix. On larger projects, we used git for version control. For database management, we used SQL.'
        ,'Currently, I am a Technical Solutions Engineer at Epic. There, the core of my work is customer support but I have voluntarily taken on a number of internal development projects. One such project was a Python program to detect anomalous data in customer reported metrics. That data was pulled in from joined SQL tables and then analyzed in Python. We outputted a list of anomalous data which the supporting TS of those customers would use to reach out and verify or reconcile that data. Another project was a diagnostics script which would use powershell to pull various things from Windows in the event that our self-arrival application, Welcome, failed.'

    about: [
        'I was born and raised in northern Kentucky. I have a passion for software development which I realized in middle school. I wanted to develop mods for Minecraft. It was then that I decided to pursue a career in computer engineering. Throughout middleschool and highschool, I attended a number of computer programming courses and camps. One camp was a Java game development camp where I developed a game with a partner and presented it to an auditorium sized crowd. In highschool, I joined the robotics team where we developed fully autonomous robots to pick up and manipulate/move blocks. Some challenges at various competitions required the robots to move blocks into a goal, others required stacking them. After highschool graduation, I attended the University of Kentucky to get a bachelor degree in computer engineering.'
        , 'Some of my hobbies include: software development; backpacking and other outdoor activities; neuroscience; bowling; philosophy.'
        , 'I am a team player, I see the value in collaboration to develop and implement software in the most efficient and complete way possible. I am open minded and receptive to feedback. I am not afraid to ask questions and am always looking to learn and new things.'
